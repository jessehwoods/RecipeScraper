    "name": "Spicy Hunan Steamed Tofu & Mushrooms",
    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound silken tofu ((450g))",
        "salt ((to taste))",
        "1 tablespoon vegetable oil ((plus 2 tablespoons, divided))",
        "8  ounces oyster mushrooms ((225g))",
        "1/4 teaspoon white pepper ((or to taste; the powder is ideal rather than freshly ground))",
        "1 1/2 tablespoons ginger ((minced))",
        "3 cloves garlic ((minced))",
        "1-4 tablespoons duo jiao salted chili peppers ((ranging from normal to crazytown, depending on how spicy you want it!) )",
        "2  scallions ((finely chopped, with the white and green parts separated))",
        "2/3 cup hot water",
        "1 tablespoon soy sauce",
        "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Prepare your silken tofu by cutting it in half lengthwise and then slicing it crosswise into ½-inch slices. Use your knife or cleaver to transfer each half of the cut tofu to a large heatproof rimmed plate or shallow bowl (the dish should be deep enough to hold the steaming liquid and sauce). Lay the tofu on the plate so the pieces are fanned across either side. Sprinkle a pinch of salt evenly over the tofu.",
        "Next, steam the tofu. Add 4 cups of cold water to a wok, place the tofu on a steaming rack inside, and cover the wok. (You can set up your steaming apparatus however you’d like. Check out our full article on how to set up a steamer, even without special equipment.)",
        "Turn the heat to medium-high. The water should boil in about 7 minutes. After it has begun boiling, continue to steam for another 3 minutes––a total of 10 minutes.",
        "When the tofu goes into the steamer, heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan and brown the oyster mushrooms. Season with salt to taste. Let them brown and caramelize—flipping them when they caramelize on one side.",
        "When the tofu is done, turn the heat off, and carefully pour off the liquid that has pooled at the bottom of the plate. Arrange the caramelized oyster mushrooms over the top. Sprinkle the mushrooms and tofu evenly with ¼ teaspoon white pepper.",
        "In a clean saucepan or wok set over low heat, add 2 tablespoons of oil and 1½ tablespoons minced ginger. Cook for 1 minute, and then add the garlic and cook for another minute. ",
        "Add the duo jiao salted chilli peppers. Cook for 1-2 minutes. The oil should start turning red and fragrant. Next, add the white portions of the scallions. Give it a stir for another 10 seconds, and add 2/3 cup hot water, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and ½ teaspoon sugar.",
        "Let the liquid come to a boil, and turn it down to simmer. Stir in the green portion of the scallions, and take the pan off the heat. Immediately spoon the sauce evenly over the mushrooms and tofu, and serve!"
